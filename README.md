### How to run Tests locally(There is a CI pipeline setup)

### Web App
TechStack used:
- Django
- OpenCV
- Bootstrap

**How it works**
- user makes a POST request by uploading appropriate file
- **Note:** Only jpg,png,jpeg files are allowed. Otherwise user gets an error message asking them to do the same
- The uploaded file is passed through `color_extract` function
- returns color_value dict. This is saved as an object instance `StripFile` along with the image.
- renders the value dict on the same webpage


### Output
![sample1](./strip_images/sample1.png)

![sample-error](./strip_images/sample2.png)
